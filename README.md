# Tim Zaman's Image Related Toolkit

Contains general and convenient classes, functions and methods related to image processing.
Most of the functions are written by myself, some are from stackoverflow, and some from the depths and cracks of the interwebs.

Note it's quite messy and contains major Doodle'ing

I sometimes include this toolkit as a submodule in github projects.
